# Exponentially-distributed-IAT-and-ST
program that automates the simulation table that we constructed in the lecture. Your program should read the values of λ1 for arrival rate and λ2 for service rate and use the steps we discussed so that the distributions of IAT and ST are exponential. The program should calculate and print the values in the simulation table
